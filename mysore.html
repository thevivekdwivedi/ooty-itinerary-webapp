  <h1>Bangalore → Mysore Road‑Trip Itinerary (18–20 Oct 2025)</h1>
  <h2>Overview – route, weather and car suitability</h2>
  <p>The journey from <strong>Bangalore</strong> to <strong>Mysore</strong> via the modern NH‑275 expressway is only about 143 km and usually takes under three hours【736897614862978†L69-L83】.  This highway is well maintained, making it comfortable for a sedan like your Skoda Superb.  Mid‑October brings warm days (around 28 °C) with heavy showers – forecasts predict about 0.63 inch of rain on 18 Oct, 0.52 inch on 19 Oct and 0.48 inch on 20 Oct【71312127340625†L150-L157】, so pack umbrellas and plan indoor back‑ups.</p>
  <p>This plan assumes you depart on the morning of <strong>18 Oct 2025</strong> and return by evening on <strong>20 Oct 2025</strong>.  Feel free to adjust times to match your pace.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.silentshoresresort.com/" target="_blank">Silent Shores Resort &amp; Spa</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Price &amp; inclusions.</strong>  Rates hover around US $140 per night (≈₹12,000) for a double room.  This resort is not marketed as an all‑inclusive property; packages usually include breakfast only.  Pets are generally not permitted.  <em>Availability:</em> A review of major booking engines for the weekend of 18–20 Oct 2025 (two rooms for four adults) found only a few rooms left.  Reserve early to guarantee your stay.</p>
    <p><strong>Why stay here?</strong>  Set beside a picturesque lake on the outskirts of Mysore, Silent Shores offers modern rooms with private balconies overlooking the water【868779044617139†L157-L163】.  Guests praise its peaceful setting【868779044617139†L157-L163】, and amenities include a swimming pool, spa, fitness centre, tennis courts and an international restaurant【868779044617139†L157-L163】.  The quiet location makes it ideal for older travellers seeking relaxation, while younger couples appreciate the resort’s recreational facilities.</p>
    <p><strong>All‑inclusive options?</strong>  We searched major travel sites and could not find a true all‑inclusive resort in Mysore.  Silent Shores offers meal plans (bed & breakfast or half board), but not unlimited food and drinks.  If an all‑inclusive experience is essential, consider the Hampi Heritage & Wilderness Resort, which has an all‑inclusive package including meals and safari【950518261969170†L166-L170】.</p>
